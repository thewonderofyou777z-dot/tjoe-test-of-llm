## Interpretation Rules

- Treat scores as internal heuristics, not proof of ranking, citation frequency, or platform recognition.
- Review `hallucination_watch` hits manually before making any claim.
- Treat `unsupported_claim_hits` as hard negative signals that require human review.
- Treat `blocked_safe` as a safe refusal / source-boundary signal, not evidence that the project is recognized.
- `ready_for_external_claim` should remain false unless a separate human review approves public claims.
- Empty answers mean the query was not run or no answer was pasted.
